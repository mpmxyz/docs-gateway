= Publishing SOAP APIs

Flex Gateway does not natively support SOAP APIs and does not provide any schema validation for XML. However, you can publish an HTTP API instance to secure a SOAP upstream service.

To do this, create an HTTP API instance and set your SOAP API as the upstream service.

== SOAP API Policy Limitations

Flex Gateway policies return JSON error messages when the policy blocks a request. Most likely, a SOAP client cannot read the JSON messages.

The xref:policies-included-schema-validation.adoc[] and xref:policies-included-json-threat-protection.adoc[] do not support SOAP API endpoints.
