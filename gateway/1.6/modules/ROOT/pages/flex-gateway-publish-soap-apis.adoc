Flex Gateway does not natively support SOAP APIs and does not provide any schema validation for XML. However, you can publish an HTTP API instance to secure a SOAP upstream service.

To create an HTTP API instance to secure SOAP API upstream service, refer to the relevant tutorial for your running mode:

* xref:flex-gateway-publish-apis-conn.adoc[]
* xref:flex-gateway-publish-apis-local.adoc[]

== SOAP API Policy Limitations

Flex Gateway policies return JSON error messages when the policy blocks a request. Most likely, a SOAP client cannot read the JSON messages.

The xref:policies-included-schema-validation.adoc[] and xref:policies-included-json-threat-protection.adoc[] do not support SOAP API endpoints.
