Flex Gateway does not natively support SOAP APIs. However, you can publish an HTTP API to secure a SOAP API endpoint.

== SOAP API Policy Limitations

Flex Gateway policies return JSON error messages when the policy blocks a request. Most likely, a SOAP client cannot read the JSON messages.

Additionally, the xref:policies-included-schema-validation.adoc[] and xref:policies-included-json-threat-protection.adoc[] do not support SOAP API endpoints.
