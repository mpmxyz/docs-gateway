If you have completed all the steps in xref:policies-pdk-create-project.adoc[], you can compile the custom policy project.

You must compile the custom policy for your source code and configuration edits to be present in the `target` directories.

After you compile, test your policy with the following tutorials:

* xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[]
* xref:policies-pdk-deploy-policies[]

== Before You Begin

Ensure you have completed all the steps in xref:policies-pdk-create-project.adoc[].

== Build Command

To compile the policy, run the `build `command from the policy's root folder:

[source,ssh]
----
make build
----

The `build` command preforms the following actions:

. Runs the `build-asset-files` goal to ensure all the changes made in the `gcl.yaml` file are reflected in all the policy asset files and to update the policy configuration exposed in the `config.rs` file.
. Runs the `cargo build` command to compile the policy to a WebAssembly binary file.
. Generates the configuration files required to execute the policy. 

The output of the build, is stored in the `target` directory.

You can execute the `build` command as many times as necessary to generate compiled artifacts. You must compile the custom policy for your source code and configuration edits to be present in the compiled artifacts.
