When using the Policy Development Kit (PDK), you might encounter issues with PDK itself. See the following sections to help you resolve these issues:

* <<cargo-credential-provider-configuration, Cargo Credential-Provider Configuration>>

To debug issues with your custom policy, see:

* xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[]
* xref:policies-pdk-debug-deployed-policies.adoc[]


== Cargo Credential-Provider Configuration

When running the `setup` or `build` commands, you might receive the following error:

----
cargo +nightly install cargo-anypoint@1.0.0-beta.1 --registry anypoint -Z registry-auth --config .cargo/config.toml
warning: flag `-Z registry-auth` has been stabilized in the 1.74 release, and is no longer necessary
  Authenticated registries are available if a credential provider is configured.

    Updating `anypoint` index
error: failed to download `cargo-anypoint v1.0.0-beta.1 (registry `anypoint`)`

Caused by:
  unable to get packages from source

Caused by:
  authenticated registries require a credential-provider to be configured
  see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/registry-authentication.html for details
make: *** [install-cargo-anypoint] Error 101
----

To fix the error:

. Find your Cargo main directory (`.cargo/`).
. In `.cargo/`, find the `credentials.toml` file and add the following new line `credential-provider = ["cargo:token"]` to the '[registries.anypoint]` section, for example:
+
[source,toml]
----
[registries.anypoint]
token = <someToken>
credential-provider = ["cargo:token"]
----
+
NOTE: Do not edit the `token` field.

. Save the changes.
. Run the `setup` or `build` command from your custom policy root directory. The command should now execute properly.
