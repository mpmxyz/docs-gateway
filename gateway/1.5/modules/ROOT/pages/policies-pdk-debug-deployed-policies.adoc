If a custom policy deployed on a Flex Gateway is malfunctioning, there are some different methods to debug the policy:

* <<debug-environment>>
* <<debug-logs>>

[[debug-environment]]
== Use the PDK Debugging Environment

If you haven't already used PDK's debugging environment, it is suggested you begin there.

The PDK debugging environment provides an easy way to view Flex Gateway logging and send a variety or requests.

For more information about PDK's debugging environment, see xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[]

[[debug-logs]]
== Troubleshoot in a Production Environment

It is possible that errors that are nor present in PDK's debugging environment are present when the policy is deployed to a production environment.

To use debug logs in a production environment, see xref:flex-troubleshoot-debug-logs[].
