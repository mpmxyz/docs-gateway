The Policy Development Kit (PDK) is a software development kit that enables Flex Gateway users to develop custom policies with ease.

PDK provides step by step instructions to guide you through the policy development lifecycle, from implementing your Rust source code to releasing your policy on Exchange. PDK abstracts the user from the minute detailed associated with policy development by autogenerating configuration files and providing a simple interface.

PDK also provides some template policies to help you get started with policy development.

To begin using PDK, start by:
