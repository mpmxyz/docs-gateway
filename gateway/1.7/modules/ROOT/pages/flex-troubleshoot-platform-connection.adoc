When configuring Flex Gateway in either mode, it is possible for the Flex Replica's `registration.yaml` to get lost or for the replica to lose connection to Anypoint Platform.

To troubleshoot if a registration file is present and if Flex Gateway can make platform connections, Flex Gateway provides the following command:

[source,ssh]
----
flexctl check connections
----

The `flexctl check connections` first ensures a `registration.yaml` file is present, and then checks if the replica can connect to the URLs defined in the registration file.
